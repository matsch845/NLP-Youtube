Whole block equally heavy pressure KÃ¶hler yes parts brought along crankcase actually most important component yes of course special features look well why think spare wheel recess reserve recess yes flat overall height would be standing crankshaft vertical looking out yes already completely standing yes works exactly works both cylinders see left right ok cooling water finally flows around discovered construction flows around exactly at night ok camshaft tappet keys were in it like this below basically quite okay good okay special special basically housing integrated left right two generators two generators 15 kw separate room under electric senate 15 15 15 x 230 kw said separate room fit yes electrically combined work series 30 shocked further common cooling circuit can see knock over hold relatively connection circuit combustion come right welcome cold side first starts generators purely erkrather from which go out afterwards both cylinders r combustion engine ok-power why understand v2 just really warm bulldog bombelmann 1 calms down why ask again two generators done the following crankcase inside big gear drives both gears below generators run right run left exactly trick crankshaft rotates direction both gears rotate important rotation disturbing vibrations output zero aggregate external calm would have felt very briefly accenture weights yes award weights quasi quasi cabbage piston weight blue weight crankshaft yes counterweight all canceled due to both generators running in opposite directions exactly weight finally compensated generators balancing writing weight writing above generators centrifugal force no routes rotate rotate center schmidt to compensate for any weight differences generators belong together as a block accenture capable geil means gear drive camshaft exactly drive control drive two valve head two valves very simple simple structure missing turbocharger more 40 kw power would be desirable structure position pressure 30 is already 40 would be option 50 small turbocharger large large larger more exaggerate okay okay okay whole thing weighs 65 kilograms yes car legal weight would be okay currently 8 front vehicle in it belongs nevertheless always long exactly vehicle 20 liters yes depending on the range can be set as you like think it's nice really cool invention compact spare wheel recess engine build say dismiss joke change it 1 hour developed developed yes outside heat radiates yes heat expect yes depends yes below free vehicle radiated below certainly wind oh means separate curci exhaust system muffler must be outside yes vehicle should leave course loud infusion ventilation quasi noise always yes rosy hear you feel yes nothing lives flattened cool tell well there you can see again picture two generators above winding heads connection three-phase generators also electrical together en coupling both generators sum 30 kw connection vehicle strong engine motor started driving both generators would have to start otherwise further reason granted design yes rubbish case said both generate electricity generators trapp just give machine electric machine both directions can be used costs think probably 2000 euros about offer product know little sell starter 2000 euros bad consumption engine quasi converted 100 kilometers topping up norms violates yes selection combustion engine consumes yes there are norms type vehicles hybrid character consumption 1 4 liters 100 kilometers corresponds to 32 grams of co2 so far even per kilometer driven colleague makes 32 means who rhein hoch 2007 on the way fundamentally enormous develop future should fulfill really already hot topic colleague key word must winter yes really needs more heating places left vehicles heating really energy consumption really energy times may run yes first electrical yes viz thermal management house thermal management colleague acronis exactly new product see product see makes ready ready drive it's segerath little distance 4 8 drive can look thermal management module module heat cool ok just seen battery vehicles winter heat problem 5 8 kw heat output needs of course range correspondingly limited warming use solve exactly known resistance zone vehicle kw 1 kw heat output heat pump inserts 1 kw power supply 3 kw heat output ratio one three helps range accordingly yes increase massively 40 percent get result see small thing see exactly vehicle company streetscooter okay small small commercial vehicle company rwth aachen created itself car exactly deal with research development application construction electric vehicles exclusively purpose-built case said commercial vehicle letter package distributor service work together two two projects both with the range extender with the management module en products installed in vehicles
