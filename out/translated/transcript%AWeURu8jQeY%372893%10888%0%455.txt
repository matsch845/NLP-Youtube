Music suspense the following video contains technically highly sophisticated content as well as complex explanations hope you feel the world view just say roughly energy arises valve slams back nt seat basic same topic actually calculate mass mass weight acceleration assumes valve stops abruptly stop moving speed ickx just happened briefly just discussed about it actually creates infinitely large force exactly even distance above to stop valve theory practice natural components steel aluminum reality spring compress valve of course sees valleys pull largest weight pull down happens plate starts swinging therefore infinitely large force arises simply part effect head part spring effect valve works yes big force actually variable yes mother adjustment stop different profile valve means yes really sees thielemann adds makes hangs yes duct in it means profile picture piece stream angle yes important similar naturally aspirated luf t better guided man tower wall- just want to believe just open the damn channel boys second just as complex say engine exhaust side valve rowling jürgen wahl however difficult no blank offer yes creates already finished polished chrome-plated ducks processed overlong just as tulip shape just pretty roughly forged movement goes out edit out shape basically say since almost things find intake valve flatter angle exhaust valves take larger angle intake valve flatter general commonality in-outlet many engine concepts find valve shape strong channel shape dependent channels up coming down need valves shape channel down side comes down corner goes know toyota 2 az head no really chaos good yamaha made a lot of different channels loose fluffy right tailor root works yes fall piece wide question makes channel strong corner comes flat re valve angle proven channel more above comes bigger who bigger flat en angle advantage air up top flows down plate slams corner means a bit of a corner lead practically air around leads power hear angle larger radius gives specialists vlis bank valve frame test ratio diameter valve piston wants to evaluate vegetables come flow saver channel find out ideal valve shape of course always need pattern try a bit of clay on it whole maine series engine example yes taken drives 25 bar boost pressure camshaft Rhine hub say three millimeters increased behaves boost pressure related hub first time even changed boost pressure even back pressure lower correct boost pressure changes moment inlet closing inlet opens outside push both points boost pressure actually really relevant moment inlet valve outlet valves closed both open point boost pressure overflows correctly boost pressure overwhelmed inlet valve purely abroad closed stop outlet out effect ensures additional air expenditure air simply disappear t free power cools room oil says cools combustion chamber correct combustion chamber ensures total exhaust gas combustion chamber displacement pushed out flushed games effect is created by fresh air flows combustion chamber flushes cylinder exhaust gas open exhaust valves direction exhaust manifold may of course remain large natural frame loses change jerk say good area move game effect fabric finds open turbo engines already quite good games effect millimeter overlapping soap two ok direction 3 goes rule already section right war high right wins more 2 3 mm 2 mm combustion chamber clean emptied exhaust gas clean flushed cooled home say yes read never try strength made truth is testing wonderfully simple test brings really real results consider happen end therefore leads past it private question from it private gives old photo say times properly turned look when gives starts rattling good youth made things table lie earlier ford on the way vw quite cape uttmachen polo example self-built old tractor lever polo screwed around on it ring on the way first jk matrei ghh also available sebastian 160 hp allow space ak 75 hp exactly hooked 260 hp bad luck gk could quite music get more driving degree example highest waves degree really driving comes seen have believe dreaming white believe find more exciting plays 360 degrees opening angle yes long stays valve at all 360° will no intended reason knew wrong logic here very clearly stands imagines thought 360 degree circle camshaft 360 degrees must work full circle consideration yes thumbs up opening angle camshaft revolutions specified crankshafts two one exactly means camshaft come half namely 180 degrees trick here 63 360 degrees tomorrow 360 degrees crankshaft revolutions open camshaft 180 degrees angle is already experiencing big race waves two petrol engines second part experienced four valves big two valves 360 degrees already ball height 100 0 revolutions usual racing choose opposite direction 336 degrees porsche se yes direction summit 336 degrees 336 degrees 312 degrees once heard at the opel tests correctly hydro tappets quasi engine built the same work see times give correct speed look physical limits believe today portfolio today unfortunately came feel had to go today had to prepare topic equipment set up test benches so far ok deep pockets hydrologist degrees climate grazer degrees say more opening angle automatically more power found out gives negative effect straight 360 degrees spoken air natural combustion chamber in the higher the speed the less time air inertia means sag piston air air pushes oh look piston goes down moves front makes valve already tight air even more pure less air combustion chamber needs to say may valve stay open longer opening angle longer ideal air combustion chamber own inertia compressed overfilling space generated makes valve quickly more air captured mathematically fit in maximum possible power or maximum possible torque reaches opening angle longer make think better, namely the following air column compresses the combustion chamber valve always makes air goes back pulls air running out makes valve less air in it fit in comes valve closes late piston already indicated piece gone up Less residue yes filling smaller compression shrinks more 10 bar 8 7 6 basically means large opening angle negative effect hole thing understood sucker said company wito motor songs pressed in believe when when when turbo clear effect charged on the way nevertheless point piston theoretically below boost pressure on it two bar overpressure combustion chamber valve piston goes up pushes decoration pressure higher cargo space total exactly prints pushes air out makes valve long less volume fresh gas combustion chamber insofar effect same with the supercharged engine basically shorter opening angle on the way 360 degrees yes camshaft brought greatest performance boost history fights follows puma thought yes of course car ford puma 125 hp 1.7 liters gets quality yes affordable optimist come straight always bucket construction camshaft before after knife why excited clean 17 105 120 comes at all number fixed years ago somehow 20 hp brought 20 25 years first tender camshaft model really performance made drive compare performance peak performance torque increased distance gas went performance high maybe construction ford little tame yamaha engine believe developed at that time actually yes wanted wanted to know why assume engine concept ducts intake manifold exhaust system more performance thought camshaft engine throttled lottenweiler a bit moderately larger yes more cross-section releases thing really explodes 25 hp with clean torque yes decisive believe built-in happy most coveted piece wave sold says renner goes renner history say renner bmw m 10 yes incredibly many choose n continue to sell bmw m 10 year although cars almost drive on the road sees very short m 10 bmw series four-cylinder goes 30 there were very old living oil pipe quasi camshaft runs well stop thielecke exactly sold 54 sell right waves already really tuning aspect people use yes these days already Said does chip tuning then gives loud air cooler exhaust systems engine oil pistons steadfastness tell me calling station tuning bluish steadfastness camshaft really actually always apart sucker area circuit done sometimes always done late least meaningful effect seen in said okay map exhaust large air out la therefore air in someone is after that Yearly valves actually door performance unfortunately only quite late recognized conclusion understood okay times even turbo engine first time cheaper quotation marks more performance efficiency just as well bank bug simply finance higher classic first boost pressure turn up the end made little intake manifold exhaust system Ge, etc. several boost pressure turn up larger loader on it intercooler on it goes more runs moment comes camshaft game lets find camshaft would be noticed long last years more people weeks notice people more sucking up engines older m gmbh vehicles increasing demand notices classic summer tuning just new vehicles two just four-cylinder charged information boring says yes understand emotions cylinder turbo very topic yes directly 1 motorsport skillful yes already related weeks have gone there today fifteenth sucker difficult can you come by experience 107 ag thi gladly finished facts may see camera bag lobby may throw who built area boys exactly yes camshafts dangerous manageable devices hedge many machines several processing yes may talk come simple statements dark yes exactly who say case bread cars white cash classically wood first day of work was made times overwound who is ready of course h cast parts get accrued makes camshafts neustadt classic thoughts 3 roth ja na music
