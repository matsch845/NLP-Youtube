clubsport get down to performance before really discuss clutch original clutch clubs present see talk settled exactly show come in take send supply chain move out whole sachs honestly say satisfied products just fine may just build car regard really well do hit several problems things arise really regulate lap time well do things really needed to transport power original clutch idea gets weaker become heavy just because package automatic weighs 19 kilograms organic clutch disc dual-mass flywheel means two measures seemed scales just remember 19 kilograms dual-mass flywheel why consumers dual-mass flywheel two masses funny whole thing built-in chants on it okay piston connecting rod on it mounted there is a lot of power on it side clutch discs automatic transmission situation 6000 revolutions sound gear three four lanes of course mast differences speed differences engine side transmission side means impact caught component see position torsion springs absorb impact reason example often stands engage car sweet way drives off okay means first moment contact takes place flywheel organic ready to absorb certain friction feeling no matter clutch pedal notice exactly gives evenly ok comes software possible transplant more torque more torque transports contact surface transfer rubs okay enough energy is generated transmission cable stands slips power land happens remove heat points flowed on it dual mass flywheel partially organic disc automatic machine happened high heat points deformation metal means point more completely could surface organic coating stop working well surface contact built up example yes you want more surface on it highest point force transmits contact structure 19 kilograms of spring force at the top of the machines decisively transport more force pack the new side kilograms are okay cars clutch right m sloppy yes definitely mom should have flat tires opel meriva run goes 90,000 service clutch new manufacturer actually okay yes comparison politician top class contact looks soft quite relatively far almost quite soft get receipt hertha feelings love talk about it actually do a bit modern build namely after lap time fast shifts happen transport pressure line reserve on top yes ok goes pressure pressure pushes reserve ensures automatic pressed pressure reducer hate loco that car drives yes totally totally elegant you have fast switching process due to pressure reduced pressure line says automatic go back evenly drive really fast means simply dad dad means go home out afterwards clutch paper very quickly couple pressure transport pushes slip in out in out fast technically goes mass momentum momentum another advantage compared to weight less centrifugal mass means engine revs cheaper high revs less mass forward dr before big advantage comes disadvantage always experience say problems are happening is coming russell noise rattling noises expelled side everywhere yes flywheel rotates ensures very high evenness idling and packing just variation love trust club sport sintered metal rubber four packs four individual contact points winter organic miss rubber look closely see shiny part metal parts organic surface 1 contact moment transport hole just small ok seconds just different really private difference know sinter metal say organic says turning drive organic transport hit harder hit clutch moment lap time moments double-declutching moment almost uncomfortable makes unrest vehicle yes clutch transport force good clutch moves in pushes short in front okay both 3 and two three means maybe even see better torsion fight sintered metal organic leaf position absorb forces a little goes fulfill a little task e.g Weimal already should look thing weighs 1821 grams 1007 190 grams today both fall so think about it decide sintered metal clutch aq plus position namely hold sometime drive car made extreme bring more kindergarten use beginning actually difficult means first vehicle is situation car hardly really doesn't matter therefore obstruction sintered metal clutch organic lining let car go stay out of course main question weighs package understood yes yes yes yes already explained 19 19 see yes machines already differences exactly many thick materials comparison curved original time masses flywheel weighs little show 13 kilograms 13 kilograms weighs package just compare 19 kilogram find top six kilo really awesome six kilo weight loss transport more torque part removed best clutch feeling transmit more power five six kilograms weight saved modification years topic masses flywheel have questions straight organic covering of course equal moderate clutch behavior buddy have magnificent grinding moment go thing clutches have guys imagine more sometime transport big difference says technologically cool already top due to disproportion sintered metal organic can imagine thing tear loose less take out happen even when starting sometimes comstage k comes in have to turn at some point really describe more closely fits fits newton meters net drive hot clock rings three four full carrots need strength already lie ready again completely assembled knowledge is more used on it immediately swimming pool in workshops lighter sort always classify rattle noises already more white school makes really low have low-speed area slightly metallic noise is because of that just write stop strong discs dual mass flywheel torque easy fusion of two cushion stop noise completely eliminate increase driving comfort main reason why assist stop poem rotatable Cheerfulness always comes tachometer full speed heavy bucket flywheel almost the same please note speed down music point relatively fast speed why speed decreases speed faster axis of rotation mass simply lower means centrifugal forces less so ball strives always turns relatively great may forget crankshaft loaded bearings scarf carbon knoll turn mass percentage determined five kilo taken mass complete makes sure less flywheel mass thing down back why do brakes need to be tight english shift down speed falls faster okay third gear go fourth gear four 2 happens fast enough falls yeah torque motor simple speed point gear ratio number second second gear torque four degrees starts double-declutching exactly hits stop shifting down speed slowly falls you always hit moment build simple car visions sports equipment works easier school yes any club therefore light shoes jogging why centrifugal force less gena inconvenience operation here simply more accurate less mass stands metallic hold see find compromise comfort sporting value perfectly sufficient really perfectly sufficient completely forbidden goes hint of sportiness remember mass already incurred costs say clutch capital quite well set up example yes just really crass diesel thing matt screen came in so dare again for sure Please listen due to the lower vehicle weight reach really warm engine true look noticed force holds really higher hold hauser wirth lighter therefore rubber kissel except two gas buttons there are 1000 artists cuba crass software little follow-up time under the roof music namely transmit data immediately have to produce own errors leave the car with a full tank of fuel driven 1000 meters unfair price hot have to have to calculate errors have to calculate a lot of data individual costs determine individual wheels just know exactly errors succumb just double-declutching mentioned yes there are cars j uni yes i30 enya itself double-declutching gives back a later program more complex yes yes more complex generally makes sense says okay yes stop man yes says find fascination motorsport driving heel top driving actually makes more necessary nowadays duo braking phases bams drive felskuppe 123 go brake ok even find brake gears underneath go double-declutch even though brake luca longer dsg car makes so see let's just know say new parliament weight vehicle arrived really and weight makrolon discs inside mass crash cars absolutely full tank of course ideal comparative value there must know better rich start weighed car namely half full believe yes full means calculate the difference sum just a good 30 kilograms heavy completely available why does no one get harm from it demand macro wage shear demonstrated sliding window already right just car today marco lohr cologne side honestly say bring does almost series decide easy christmas talk ausbalan cated front wheel good area assume quite balanced few components could move 217 guide 221 kilograms always absolutely level 1202 kilograms weigh follow songs said full tanked action half a day x guess the end effect pull off far 110 120 kilograms weight loss car comes in bucket seats actually always normal car yes done got modification really a bit of cash losses eyes increase rear lid heavy golf lie already crass expected yes oroya from notices old yes thing very easy build vehicle geometry massively changed child completely again take 15 kilowatts therefore more scale shape same cars all that already pig yes you really icy silence satisfied really stand car good easy goes performance music
