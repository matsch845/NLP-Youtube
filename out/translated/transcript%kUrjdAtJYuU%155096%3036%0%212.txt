red- fine long gone michalsen understood do karlsruher janacek build children's run bank heart motors that's why hot frit fat already totally nervous goes canned geb chain equally exciting hey hello more countries write good yes starts directly prototype production directly spontaneously let's live drivers prototypes do things see see through it werdenberg cut away teeming plenty of cast hall see processing v engines means radek processing completely completely finished live work learn delivered worthless screwed yes yes nice good driver's cab prototype construction go first match room half a little water goes prototypes long goes aluh v6 yes seen yes special aluminum say aluminum mainly high-priced segment Piston rings used runs directly aluminum career actually blogs nothing at all runs call bring contact blog exactly very special comes mainly high-priced segment use standard four-cylinder liner you certainly know heavy things individually never had yes nowadays az speaks 50 percent yes friction arises jersey contact cylinder liners piston piston rings 50 percent 350 arises really the same work actually generate energy 50% ribe lose more energy contact accomplish cylinder exactly 50 percent 50 mechanical losses bird oil lubricated kolping drum it off scraper yes even that's why working on it you've already seen an advantage coating weight layer more potential layer yes processing 150 microns of course super heat transfer super heat dissipation energy heat layer goes in directly inntal water cooling exactly as a result higher compression right temperature goes down get charge driving angle driving more power more efficient motors second, so to speak point third point layer porous why august completely tight you have many small pores piston rings similar to aquaplaning floats drilling less friction exactly smoother get surface complete retention volume flat generates largest g Largest part layer generated means smooth surface effect upswing piston ring thus less friction sounds good come red time more and more 50 percent reduce friction already whole pieces already reduce tuning piston ring layer high finally good 20 25 percent friction reduction possible come forward will be security always believe before little nintendo first half million go believe go prototype building capo manuel new work board floor about 50 location yes part of it special prototypes coating plant see processing sequence for coating important okay means times bus comes keys machine works surface specially activated leads coating active hot quasi seam anchoring mirror coating profile outer track exactly layer aluminum holds okay coated yes all usual it works engine incredible looks yes almost all whole determination take dogs yes about 250 micrometers out stays 150 cylinder track sc bad ok sounds exciting already prepared yes say anyway show cooking yes prepared winter type yes sees prototypes say ok block already prepared coating exactly allowed in yes very good question yes see lance landscape turning in yes shoots quasi surface say wire mennel wheel wheel help arc melted similar to welding melt ford escort intermediate question times wheel times wire are location send large country heated wire strong quasi sweat welds town hall comes rotation lance flies material equal cylinder wall then almost evenly coated exactly almost exactly need yes chicken there therefore you want to say correctly stop belt organ put put 7 organ rain say gives boost rocket first of all mansfelder really puts pressure on it immediately draws brain oslo on it layers died really yes press yes expensive machine always going to break it's rocket good piece yes fast hot blog 60 70 degrees hotter may mean aluminum question see above wire hate meter wire walk dr on blog single for four-cylinder about 40 meters per cylinder ten meters 10 meters wire per cylinder this results in gray dust exactly feat fuel advertising exactly reduces friction yes already mentioned about 2025 percent yes want to know for sure co2 makes father yes co2 makes per kilometer about two three grams savings 2 milligrams per kilometer reason lower friction piston was piston rings raceway lower friction inside advantage better heat dissipation possibility direction weight yes considered discuss definitely two three four five six kilos comes number of cylinders cylinders really say one and a half kilos possible to save super interesting many many thanks things small test run listen yes probably always let sparks fly falls definitely will continue text is correct good question tell colleague game many career trade stock yes main problem kolbe
