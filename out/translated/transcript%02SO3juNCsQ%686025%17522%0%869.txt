Music music question question why n1 hoe gras powerful honest 470 hp sees sucker rogers 450 74 why naturally aspirated 2.8 3.5 3.5 3.5 carer single out anyway sucker 470 hp loaded thousand thanks piano five cars first 470 km 1 huge legend I’m sure a lot of bmw fans know the car even detail actually at the moment there’s a lot of hype about cars experiencing relatively quiet at the moment who just got extremely attention last two years last year always lets loose made giant leap last four five years okay really good reaction at the moment you gave it yes barn find was restored dealer sicily found rest of family thought stands question workshop garage a little disappointed hurt cars blatant cars collector parts example trainer tus art car 20,000 run cars are 750 up really cool car only car always difficult to sit in it never have hands soy want yes car designed motorsport yes, pure communication car, classic mistakes, final logs rt sit in it very straight in try it just felt first moment old ferrari courses old lotus first correct sitting position strong effect takes getting used to have to play music 80s since 1980 79 81 old think 78 80 car should 79 80 dare old cool yes initially cooperation lamborghini closure lamborghini yes insolvent Colleagues always colleagues meanwhile gave pension whole drum night fog action lamborghini driven things collected quickly bmw belonged fear afterwards explain explain exactly lamborghini bmw chassis made together yes of course engine is bmw clear just then say super sports car great let's get more know-how shop in let's see better working together clearly lamborghini much more experience somehow working together right now city development okay yes really interesting for sure at the moment supra toyota history quite quite loudly entertaining yes already 1 1 part past bit bmw already made several times ago who bigger we who really benefit sometimes nice thing people of course emotional optician just often maybe smaller part building part sees more important path to have just started cooperations long fox right at the beginning building cars late 20s actually early 30s whole bodies came sindelfingen street first own vehicle first own chassis bmw constructed recorded technical newspaper drove over colleague mercedes office looked at said colleague mercedes aspect rear part frame first time bmw said time then clearly bmw yes yes zero started company bought cars under license assembled right vehicle construction level were whole know-how just look who goes to help whole decades always come out of it exactly yes always engine exactly broker specification flat slide could show more flexible very very cool people 2 connected but purely big advantage flat shot due normal throttle valve have normal range would always have throttle valve range mi tte so flow would be ideal condition turbulence used full diameter flow channel flat shot have full load hole would be therefore dosage really identical full load is determined 15 10 percent more flow volume turbulence alone say performance increase determined five percent bottle thing who something card tronic small things google directly something like that right sport works rubble diameter old forest boasted just let the engine see sensitive topic son pipe diameter six times naturally aspirated engine lower sales volume example turbo charged engine of course real real means response behavior driving behavior 9000 advises 5,000 really bag screws level let's say really go why exhaust back pressure low means exhaust gas opens cleanliness perfection air fuel mixture combustion chamber relatively bad easy exchange four-stroke engine just accordingly bad thing simple girl full load upstairs dish go cough see good in cough good out cough en goes assist 1 6 1 6 2 6 2 okay water needs something like that 30 40 30 agreed beforehand dare to take home may go home somehow 11 5 sunday colleagues trade 36 m 3 series who extremely sexy delhi really what just talked about at the beginning f1 mother h m 12 13 15 16 said 1300 hp said earlier scalzo last stage world champion last stage already about 14 ps3 laps lab hot lap kok on it exactly new engine blocks wall yes few used blocks both blocks brought fuel treatment additive number know higher margins gives paul rösch gives many stories porsche many quotes started at some point gasoline mixing water 1 percent 2 percent sometime says eight percent injection percent 8 percent injection british injection processors actually somehow filling quantity india comes set 8 % times found out water in it lubahn clever man cool found out would be eight percent stuff rows fill time yes team own additives Fuel mixtures experimented ne village mark was allowed last times journalists spoke at that time motorsport says you could run pit lane upstairs down completely dozy whole fumes air final extremely aggressive mixture car always drive immediately after car turned off whole fuel drained tank lines legend back then time 80s just england on the road driven whole team most teams england mechanic own car arrived Driven at home man shell totally something in a good mood yes run always get the whole state back holder boys mechanics always given a little fuel home hardly get bmw fuel boxes outside the paddock come out whole whole fuel lines tell resolved yes a few times videos 50 drive ethanol content high softener rubber pulled out line example experience awesome converted ethanol e85 before winter two suitcases opened systems trunk built secondarily fill up kitsch tank all come lines falls apart just ground think winter believe coming engine speak 1.5 displacement really speak h albliter bottle volume promised 18 e motor golf 4 0.3 day more cubic capacity engine series real coup 1.5 liter cubic capacity turns see 11 think someone help yes prescribed yes m3 e36 speak 11,000 turn times very cheeky claim superior relatively short normal engines have been used then standard blocks 15 engines petrol engines right two liters exactly why made material sets yes whole material sets whole gust gust block sets means whole heat treatment hits hit treatment yes today there run through even process everyday operation normal people namely very modern engines word brand new factory always gives places areas simply set certain material blog thus heat cracks arise high thermal load 3 1 guide comes thus used books taken hundreds of thousands of blocks some blocks somewhere around the corner are people yes peed on them always taken stock makes sense close close even big red remember gave those pro k really giant big krömer from gas volume man therefore of course 9000 11.000 higher rpm range plus engine falls mainly high rpm range really emits exhaust gases come out two flood twin scroll exhaust housing means shock charging single piston yes rhythm krimmer individual channels pierce stop big advantage come pierce moment exhaust gases turbine meet second moment So continuous driving force constantly producing buchs went of course compressor small compressor really interesting even then throttling really crass dosage performance throttle valve compressor screwed people means office suit bridge compressor means goes curve in air cooler yes as well as conceivable see wind running stands finger intercooler rubbing above setup costs from 1 on the way colleague that's why modern engines flap yes up target stop more busy active environment overtaken no means 11,000 revolutions go gas turbine turns boost pressure someone full lada stop unfortunately turns profit goal really long soak means more really full carrot load program possible means advantage on the gasquets charge means full carrot war already extremely cool to see dry sump lubrication yes two green crankshaft goes second outside says guys afford small engine pressure knows why basecape happy heads up gas volume drives lahrer thus think lines somewhere sixth gear course knight limited at some point it's enough exhaust flow say race yes extremely piquet that's why become world champion extremely intelligent driven used boost pressure always driven down extremely driven up really needed thing whole race complete pressure was yes yes 800 800 hp driven 800 hp drive partly engine helton car answer well drive piquet junior timmelsjoch drove car appointment closed own route just mention it ok describes own route 1.1 kilometers yes small curve curve sour for that good ok cool interesting think interesting talks yes often engines formula 1 crass yes motor come formula 1 nowadays anderbrügge woman ten formula 1 back then is called box naturally aspirated engine of course gasoline mist airflow was sprayed is a great recording youtube why just clean it up clean it music means superior area complete fuel mist extremely pressure channel prevails engine provides 15,000 100 more 11,000 turned 17 18 17 18 18,000 revolutions wrong only question 1 equals sign 1000 euros defended look abroad car clean car white standing clean finally yes pardon yes you called tomorrow half past three means yes come shortly find died searched find permitted diameters says richter yes at that time rottenegg which regulated services however performance open gave yes debate last last motor porsche produced was designed question performance actually said 800 sour yes car engine yes open structures x5 go music yes depends exhaust system also includes two completely open thing 750 67 hp people today unfortunately makes cool s achen never late 30 entertain yes wanted engine year should thought duster organized year air filter hood thuringian companies is already standing rolls royce engine 30s associated tria question say any life unit yes say exactly say water pump animal exit vote you have okay yes later think water pump somehow convinced again compactly built hunting awesome driving deer who never saw money last time yes yes three three admitted rather orange wings batmobile by the way already danger hottest babies yes really drive her myth her m1 super cool thing drive why m30 engine yes better better 1 anyway enough power tires anyway bit overwhelmed straight hate good csl yes material removed partially hood doors went really crass wings little war three and a half 4000 war whole body own frequency thing completely booming starts hansa noise has noise has noise ecosystem noise at m3 e30 6000 would have exceeded whole car resonance body r Resonance body put quite nicely malta already makes super super master the easiest transverse drive really say relatively quickly in there yes honestly there are bmw drivers hard square before first of all honestly 216 grand tour 216 old construction 90 2001 actually of course always own perception cars most almost as often all too admit a lot of dangers honestly maybe listen to the brand stand the epitome of a perfect cross pass at the same time means driving pleasure traffic is of course quite areas bmw edf 34 all cars white happy goes completely openly put deadly fun porsche cross drive example whole number think the same body mind construction site porsche see white car provide incredible fun 635 csi 2002 ti peng know climb 1 basic idea sports car fun fulfill cars always therefore there car limited slip differential can even just 73 37 automatic more have 1 25% limited slip differential 18 may come okay yes more correct no can distinguish two things apart from the note tow hook original ta actually know car three four years built composite simple floor originals car stands museum car route route drive said comes 1 2 build car route go for the first time rearrange small hidden unfortunately show screws tight center console panel behind data recording simply read out then something proud mal nut handle 230 sexy of course say reflex hang written good chrome son replica make make of course first of all new car that's why the car can somehow calm down aging yes exactly get really cool m5 touring e34 manual transmission gave started grandiose best west listen thought pressed opposite opposite opened photographer photos said would like to have car photo get car of course enough unfortunately enough held up sunday thank you almost white motors acidic cars inside ok yes even heard you have to be careful go in please steer far to the left as soon as you see something middle hand foil think go back things may namely film is prototype pretty fu nky kassel days later never seen yeah asshole 23 first series s a is special capital also south africa same same topic at 333 south african colleagues say need water need power fuel bad need power partly high mountains easy air goes manual gave almost 200 pieces yeah okay say really first ds see see comes just last monday following condition condition came container good times got cleaned yes long fought for it finally collection car just heard piece far good 23 times years just missing yes never heard 71 motor car manual transmission yes already meant car especially south africa ventilation left whole Leather upholstery at that time pilot project bmw man leather upholstery completely covered in leather South Africa at that time occasion first said tried first time money earlier South Africa yes many nothing at all gave elite clearly money clearly money just South African leather at that time due to first car more and more leather interior South Africa cars built where actually been made dry only in the process of finding out the whole story circumstances car safe car just mr pischetsrieder was driven africa times board bmw time with the board just bmw south africa almost sunday finally do whole tells car dealership originals mister bean car put on top signature driver right exactly way down yes yes yes almost could steer see steering wheel very exciting yes thinks namely first steering wheel above underneath underneath again steering wheel doesn't matter yes day question just actually looked hand 38 son james bond car screens had two cameras yes englishman pain easy handlebars just hoped happened effort many thanks cool sure second last time weber thank you thank you hope bmw freaks
