Music would have 39 bmw e30 m3 pick up a little bit exactly topic problem problem would be installing today test driving come for it today separate video car time penalties traffic technology has become more difficult to understand happy car really loud says car basic substances basic basis afterwards maybe technically good components wheel bearings bearing chassis go over built chassis honestly today say boys kw actually chassis boys kw really coffee sales quite sell driver assembled price really mega believe is more three forms really really really absolute power amplifier exactly driver comes in comes a lot of things seen piece bearing knocked out rubber broken bearing completely ass time very classic just touch m3 original in it m3 e30 casemod colored casey case sports chassis caf√© paris alone comes lie pull yes really technologically seen complete already pair of shoes come big effort 73 times sees namely both times both times left side namely m3 e30 welded on see head wheel bearing on it sits whole mount brake caliper part okay that's why new chassis weld seam had to get second pair of dampers in front m 330 of course really cool really cool fantastic just wanted wheel bearing pressed on wheel loader really broom exactly new wheel bearing on it brake system come on it technology damper compensation damper compression rebound adjustable comes horny part support lower spring plate see yes school stored usually just better plate works quite well google fall normal adjustable height adjustable really absolutely adjust again whole front rear axle rear axle just looks yes close to sexual harassment close makes real bike makes real forest time lazy end driven many race series driven driver sees exactly exactly something like that street car half street car stop already and end horny chassis comes quasi short version color times second video topic colored driving problem premium equal plane los angeles fly ways n rear damper is 3500 grams ok yes individual fly error 1100 grams 4600 grams 2.27 three and a half kilos compensation damper ok damper system compensation reflects really whole technology whole share technology works well many adjustment options lighter normal standard yes think bike urgency have to work car drive normally found allowed goes must case operate car accordingly species-appropriate times move exactly main points in option car yes why bike out really dear guy always sounds cart drive swedish jennie carroll built car car point sell car rear recording switzerland fried on it nice comes on bratenkowa on fried nut nut was welded in new system go on it okay original place damper system comes in separate damper neither package error looks normal positions rear yes normal parking position opposes damper normal rear inside whole front axle as well as worn out rubber s alright broken whole way assembly just cool accordingly e.g. washers something like that wrong screw in it maybe a little bit dr pingel yes reasonable straight tensile forces screw yes times on it strength screw cattle yes for free place screw yes car yes serial car of course say 30 year old plates have great forces skid marks already forces car really fast really powerful reason why videos car came to a standstill see videos always just had to build a completely new one from the start car see part built namely desperate car move quickly get new recordings simply made rolls remain flexible therefore example over there building 2 stand exhibit namely put the damper away second couple of tips fact exactly why build the whole car completely new whole side projects makes really great sense sack case whole shit show again why show it up front made sense made motors yes yes thought many normal sheet metal odd stuff find mega exciting car always get back the base see holder brake caliper okay just talked about liquid screws 8.8 animal different screws on it 4.8 pulls stop almost exactly means liquid water resistance must exactly many loads example funny see japanese screwdriver order names volkswagen screwdriver lets japanese car somehow pulls screw takes hz clear science makes just broke no there was aluminum screw japanese block quite often aluminum screws put think child german screwman tight german black forest upper arm biceps namely have to feel screw tighten general torque there screws fix there are many screws loose really sensitivity year best condition ever even game new must all things could absolutely hear the test drive car is just unbelievably brutal so build system front rear new use quasi body car really perfect tried different tires sanded hole yes more trio honestly honestly very good m motor already looks new screwed welded nut side ok see needs space exactly enough distance drive needs distance would be damper turn who drive upside down stop place normal speed driving knows about it adventurous evening put damper in the back right friend exactly mega like recording differential large differential body power keeps car things right in large 1 why does car like it relatively low look at drive shaft position drive shaft who goes uphill car fully signposted means companions state sits times tick up would like to look up at a later date differential doctor body give yes racing car see people more differential straight better position sits caravelle more down look whole thing put up better position fans social work escape differential fits well little stress possible fusilli arises fossils spaghetti farfalle italy turned in fossils background stop exhaust system stop yes be igame pressed huge problem caused sometimes happen yes little damper install big damper install big damper try two half way therefore 200 helpers continuously times passed naturally damper let go countercurrent effect damper know often really clearly smaller sound image exactly basic parts actually text form stored firmly stored sometimes completely well made a big mistake relatively strong engine normally softly mounted rigidly mounted worries about chassis blog blue ghost yellow and sit afterwards sees ball handlebars really miss bite turn wrong side algarve must knew about it more fun kw really make extra our gives car fits perfectly come across pass have to pass put today 01 23 89 3 heavier same discharge speed say yes subject exactly whole works whole conceptualize running in operation think talk running gear standing state virtual remote reality just see could tires out d back grapes suspect see gives separate train compression sees pure springs heavier out goes just as often axis can imagine hard goes in gives out quickly more pressure inside whole system separates stop different reactions damper different directions of movement goes in gives out always say must forget direction road damper means situation chassis yes chassis sits yes curl middle area means there is situation see 95 kilos up press down ok let's have a full effect on it 250 kilos of spring force yes should mistakes force ensures tension just accordingly binding force car towards the street doll weight cars already presses down need energy vehicle weight down goes more energy damper wanted wilderness willed really build up contact as soon as possible work situation drive 220 km h driving direction father slams left curve in ie okay works damper undercarriage fast enough down goes cornering slips car slightly to the left hit in came in str ate underneath group ride street moment contact tire concerns outside therefore shock absorber always position thing contact street look for the following happen tuning chassis badly adjusted damper scary vehemently presses down means goes vehicles line goes out zero point house wheels bypasses high get situation ticket caught notice eye field of vision makes first goes vertical axis uncomfortable therefore adjust chassis wheel truck important perfect drive just want to always winter car look out car job does nordschleife road bumpy up down body car regulates whole situation driver dependent next topic lane damper is sitting in there right now town hall is slightly slanted possession roll past slanting absorbing energy white yes philosophy manufacturers show understand understand even stand many fall generate absorb energy why is there ax geometry yes exactly yes linear is always space three-dimensional movement fingers do okay go down past means spring movement ng is three-dimensional town hall is yes yes yes case consider all factors thus guides divers important factor break loose moment damper production often tolerance damper perfectly manufactured you yes sits course position receives impact weather needs damper like more energy to allow first movement mountain bike cheap mountain bike shock absorber 222 euros mountain bike forum young tree why soon rear suspension notice head body belongs in it notice again is because break loose moment crass damper easy energy needed energy badly calculable so you need lowest friction fine finger damper package ensure comes all front axle load m3 comparison original 3d original 1 3 four cylinder engine in-line six-cylinder engine means weight normal position chassis need get damper nice position equalization damper yes already said piece explanation why m3 30 star a bit ashamed say honestly yes car super cool cool recep de cool stop crowd done next year really nice rampage car work rhine flows also hardly believe bread two tremors motorsport 3 bit of reform honestly can powered by videoform bit exaggerated knows projects really build garage gives phases project love love love six weeks later love shoots meet people say probably become stands always worked always believed in there phases let's go let's drive up look go stands higher doesn't matter music
