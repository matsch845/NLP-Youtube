Music hearts come new video film ag formerly gmbh talk today letter c seen view quite good alphabet believe watch already quite helpful thing bit mediated whole whole suffering really far means thought concept chances chassis sounds simple there are really crass different build up lap talk would fall go over sounds relatively boring there are really different builds most people look car e 63 weather different m3 e46 eight cars doors fenders trunk lid ready simple ok including a lot of different builds car worn things builds built up forman possibilities different builds looks afterwards behaves is ok follow industry save money go down see ladder frame ok see frame pretty construct ok big advantage ladder frame components turn variable yes industry say hey two door raptor cab newly built such drive shorter g class 6 x 6 know 66 extended normal n school system monocoque systems complicated need everywhere new pressed parts ok you supporting parts ladder frame further advantage ax parts see yes differential drive shafts almost whole rear axle body component handel ok outside filled dampers car move next systems work very variably positioning tank different attachments site manager two strands can build tank tree axles have to be built sideways motor simply sit on top ladder frame comes sits motor light oil pan ladder frame top ladder frame concept difficult ever bearing be monocoque modern frame system mini arrive system thought trucks trucks ladder frame systems good most stable buttocks simply built wood put on top stable ladder frame let certain connection sure why relatively little cross bracing yes two places cross pipes see connection goes right left robot a bit hidden exactly club so both halves connected heads of course have to again s before you see the ladder frame end comes in the front purely very well planned over really lego at that time the first lego technic models two straight struts ladder frame system very simple technology mean technology stop americans simply have to produce cars so simply built system come next system example car space frame system space frame find brate many advantages long term have to calculate look like trellis frame car build damn know side rightly reacts trellis frame advantage building pipes means you hardly press molded parts ladder frame yes certain measure certain points before prefabricated lattice pipe system teaching teaching building whole individual points have to take axis many cars outside look thought sl gullwing tubular space frame lamborghini countach tubular space frame car yes you can disguise makes a few aluminum sheets on the outside think more monocoque normal chassis system idea exactly okay example with the space frame rather point two Gitte rtubular frame tubes must absorb energies opposite see tubular frame blessing rarely place tube individually always have triangles thus always absorbed forces in different directions great advantage have mass have jagged car watch out diesel engine positioned steering gear brake booster stop construct individual tubes okay build the whole thing together can stop tubular frame relatively little money rather fund trap accident unfortunately there were bad accidents tubular space frame vehicles personally feel best racing driver world always big fan stefan bellof example 956 porsche at that time tubular space frame cars simply built lightly times simply save weight stability given okay point tubular space frame car next type construction example space frame example system at audi a8 example audi general marketing operations space frame gave vehicles technology increased gave car belief 30s already gave of course computer technology opinion really good space f rame frame chassis came first computer came simulate contest need stability of course say really could assemble simulation chassis example different materials different strengths basic materials sits together says enough glue enough sheet metal millimeter sheet 2 mm disc example stability transmit certain power have space frame frame together well different materials aluminum connected sheet metal parts put stop space frame frame together smart intelligent system think yes costs many people underestimate factory part 2000 3000 cars out short day technology difficult as soon as many components come together you have problem simply many components come together many people work on it many problem cases risks very suitable example come topic monocoque always carbon monocoque means have shell construct location consider various components to include art part monocoque malente example there are eg great pictures white straight reinge cut hate love night right carbon monocoque aventador shell man sits in it carbon rear carriage screwed on aluminum front carriage type safety cell problem carbon monocoque yes example thread screwed points weld can carbon sweat can stand woman gets must hero world point complicated monocoque thread various screwed plates points uses exactly can offer more monocoque just inside reported broken stop need complete there techniques repair lamborghini videos comprehensive way guys fly there no matter world take tools know munich car place decide mono comes used may give different things sometimes save things monocoque perfect coup keeps stiffness connection accordingly keep works from volkswagen general mqb platforms smart systems actually type monocoque half always individual subframe from built down subframe whole ax technology record upper point damper part shafts s yes you have small subframe constructs sign your task take over the whole action body structure here already really closed torsion rigid system yes central frame system in the beetle whole system pipe pipe often driving force example central pipe system built up middle horst rear plays in the GM example engine on it rest of the cars little house insight little house base plate mono in boat separate thing on it pedals tied through drives at night beetle 365 yes something yes 53 drive little house on it music works have little house on top of it drives back plays car event effort amateur things often people know a little bit more cars say also finds stupid question asked no immediately car standing look the same think yes somehow always the same system underneath huge but similar same car r8 yes lie yes sports cars should be a bit flatter 46 just go in front stupid would be very wide yes pay attention to who v engine longitudinally installed engine transversely installed m motor ready in front have problem space motorcycle little steering angle advice yes even more turning chance task whole construct really works sensibly complex task hardly people see users really device mostly unfortunately sun great developments just hide each other stop people died then 40 km/h automobile today people accidents 150 more more rise join happens car car if things shape kinks surfaces see shapes position outstanding certain surface absorb energies quasi buses sheet metal comes strength on it of course makes sheet metal comes strength those on it glad clear means smartness whole things high surfaces have example monocoque protect passers-by inside it doesn't matter shit hard around it breaks off space capsule accident pictures look future find aventador engine torn out quite often front end cancels eight screws eight screws penny more more used gives achieved whole blotch planned car stops motor stuck in there maybe worst case chew ft to the point example many say why electric vehicles in terms of good point you rule engines engines mounted relatively far back means larger crash area e 63 counter is in front people large engines power in it engine goes yes front cooler cooler piece of bumper means deliver energy full comes you have 280 kilos plots force big gate releases engine bearings including gears says ok travel direction vehicle interior thus spray turn often made to the angle engine stability motorcycle quasi breaks away yes technology in it ass protected multiple motives pretty unrest move high breaks almost whole car route at some point rough overview topic bumped car same car neither sometimes says boah good feedback good car feel monocoque car carbon hard direct damper on push system brakes when braking small rubber feet touch ok well imagine come 250 brakes down curves 110 drive car brakes inlet goes in month search damper work feel steering column ar sch ok happened ladder frame frame makes construction site house ladder frame idea things rubber bearings make sure just catch up ass kidding quasi pours yes means mostly shakes yes movement mass moves example kind girlfriend yes at home chess friends yes you are right full of it yes makes left wobbles left goes up would have teacher Back then, yes, car means hit it right, you know your ass cheeks, it goes on the left, sets, home, quite firmly, place, evening, yes, you have a right, beach, exactly, left asshole, look forward, yes, next comes several variants of the frame, cassis sometime, yes, the market price lesson, optimal solution, 3d data, product, basic structure round shape somehow right organic something shape determined organic imagine you've really made thing including rear frame nevertheless take up cash structure think imagine 3d printer piece samui lay thing 3d printer whole car whole concept whole construct part shit modification possibility yourself st√º ck closer almost piece would be can see more apart accident ettes could grow blessing put car in ddr exactly place filled yourself cool yes really good color already choose no matter say reached already recognizable studio fall really important topic tires contact surface talk very very often cars example rigid axle okay lets camber adjust camber imaginable range is plan road discussions mix tires 0 front axle camber misaligned points camber only tires rotates dreetz means yes inside traveling temperature build up more actually go table cool test stand car drives heat heat demonstrate times tires outside ass cold tires totally crap tires different means yes curve dangerous example where many two hours racing car little driven scirocco rear axle relative fall although front training rear axle cold car corner driven car just slipped ice cold why rear tires have to drive compassion hopefully work tires cold music inside builds grip clear tire road comes naturally inside high outside more outside relatively cool picture curve put tires completely have full contact surface would drive 0 graz curve start inside wheel want to relieve a bit full load full power full weight distribution tires including temperature-controlled tires yes would like to see a crash just now exactly chance must even spoken different constructions creates nice diligent direct think long view videos really bad easy yes tomorrow fun more exciting think quite good music
