Music halli hello goes text promised possible jamie dear call dr horremer says toyota actually jutta know exactly jutta watchers back then there were jutta cars there were diablo round wheels wheels explore five circles in there jutta rims yes originally comes from club owner gave sometime early times miura gave quasi fia souvenir j appendix j described quasi street car racing car change money report on goods test new york taken quasi specified criteria race responsibility quasi miura iota later plant lamborghini car crashed today more quasi accident fatalities effected completely destroyed nadine i later rebuilt svs super veloce there was jura sv gave usa jura sv brave picture edge nice came quasi sv konz lamborghini said to build five cars svj quasi only abbreviation history mogli knew there pictures gave later gave due gave agency base aventador j gave car little remembered 2012 fabric market red speedster unwanted know already called defis lamborghini aventador j jwith the new svj done enough history lessons always go to the car jutta say amazon yes go out let's go technology active dynamic mobilia active active similar system performant i can talk about it at the penalty first say very briefly before doing advertising believe svj afterwards say believe stand one narrow supports people should definitely do almost forever first do a few think mega interesting technology listen carefully thinks almost awesome stuff came on it drive car had a really blatant shape look at it car mobile middle pane angle opening slits blatant extremo things is a lot of fun details fall in love 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 19.10.11 write twelve yes fully packed elements eye catching air comes in the same way say more or less correctly introduced with the performant 20 why 2.0 flow around flow optimized imagine with the performant yes speaking directly means two air inlets on the left chimneys two chimneys problem at the ministry flow looks sympathetic ever ahnst external disturbance t of course mediation wheels you get quasi turbulence area flow naturally good central middle logically that's why said okay with the aventador fall level continue learned bring in the informant aspect grab air flow undisturbed tenants follow a little bit physically wet try if possible as easy as possible bring across makes some cool animation quite good music system more less three flaps front back down briefly often yes just little wife here exactly girl comments already stood flaps front area cooperate rear cooperate overall aerodynamic concept yes independently said airflow front comes out rear comes out rear important of course still aero Balance always have to look at the car buoyancy downforce quasi front rear balance stand critical nice driving behavior normally certain aerokit certain manufacturers may offer combination obstruct case bad intention makes technically natural aero balance car lose high speed of course dangerous would have look at the following say in it white patient flaps two flaps said there are animations let's see more clearly people quite okay there are two configurations aerodynamics flaps flaps thought at the same time greenfinch mr krämer catch just crazy flap believe goes air in wing wing means underside fluid mechanics flows air faster therefore flows less because of pressure means pressure wing ergo air pressure above car road normal normal rear wing works quasi upside down aircraft wing exactly the opposite scare passau gives constellation flap happens both flaps flows air goes in hikes asshole hikes up split left right independently can already 600 air goes in inside wing sheet left right distributed comes clou down underneath film providers are difficult there zone gap gap air front snorkel went in let out more witness pressure ski pass wr witness first laminar attached flow diaz basement mina means laminate is the opposite turbulent means flow is straight evenly surface is streamlined as undisturbed as possible runs around it although called laminate turbulent hold wing fetches even as long as possible is aerodynamics effective moment below pure bubble press both flow lines apart wm ticket loses contact wing has quasi downforce significantly reduced by 20 percent at the same time resistance of course either rumbles along it creates air resistance always a bit of a problem rigid rear wing you have gates adjust downforce low belong decide high low high low decide both variant electric motors flaps can problem would be flap up driving down on the plane need great strength full power mourn you pups valve just shout out super fast super fast steer exactly principle rian reaction speed system grandiose even formula 1 belief forbidden 2010 comes comes left right u Differently seen two flaps cornering right wheel exactly left side of the vehicle accordingly steer left quickly gives normal flaps system would be impossible fast quasi fast changing curves mainly possible when skiing understand intuitive witcher left curve puts a little weight on the left leg skis left principle be principle make one-sided clearly loaded instead more e scooters relieves the outside of the curve voi it says released piece pushes down vision as a result car curve gets all said speed want to say really noticeable rather computer really citizens aerodynamics say most noticeable speed range namely sharply defined line already clearly something 90 140 speed range karven notices higher 90 higher speeds a bit more direction stabilization car principle patent anna boos blowing in left right differently there's aviation industry there was 1 rather vectoring call quasi vector file quite different air forces professional grüttner demands the same namely front front a little simpler kept front front situation front are two flaps independently controlled electric motor forbidden walking go yes quasi detour make does just look down flap stops son the following happens flap goes majority air richter's whole concept always overall concept can existing spoiler turn flaps fit air inlets hear thinking already air outlets show lead flap to this dynamic pressure hot air bremer car brakes air madly offer air out happens air way out that goes in below view please get out this way air stays longer car lies down pushes car down always with the laminate air streamed along presses This means that the car below naturally leads to the rear spoiler with a good flow, said situation, as it were, high downforce means that you press the road, normally, the rear flap, the following happens downforce of course never air through this part air goes means reduce downforce front axle air resistance why calls resistance wear zone structures reduce give play off places two ways out air goes underbody underbody completely plan car examine therefore exhaust pipes placed diffuser rear higher pulls herb effect air flows roadway car as laminar as possible past pressure standing places accelerated diffuser visionary doing effect ground exactly comes exactly knew exactly normally counting expression yes tailpipe see normally thereby areas works maybe expand car only huge advantage huge advantage gearbox location gearbox tunnel is diffuser early start ascending normally gearbox installation space moderately means have to stay longer parallel to floor completely rear high winter very early starts rising ie aerodynamic downforce effect underbody car crass ok notices high speed motorists 350 really 350 would call say come on investigate re easy search know gives drivers 310 keep setup moderately dynamic car companies drive would say ask main reasons so to speak why car nordschleife fast course car a little more hp weight reduction car therefore strong two things combined aerodynamics efficiency means you can change well low downforce high downforce car aerodynamic mechanical grip madness all-wheel drive car optimal conditions nordschleife would drive a bit damp there's eifel from needs basic ground hold just incredible traction strong car all-wheel drive even locked have to lift hold out looks completely out yes back then six and a half kilos saved due to career hinges part device please take a look at it always oh see new dampers baby oil tempera like rheydt damper city fathers stiffness resistance all been construction danes construction pistons changed young damper forces make maximum coped with 50 percent higher 700 hp aventador 77 77 can tell easy software edu works better with even with the vacuum cleaner software namely yes hardware doctor special air intake side tell me you stop at the sound engine crisis stop bosom clean rust suction engine goes means engine start quasi filling thoughts filling more less defined valve opening curve long valve air flows in long remains open evidence limited valve accelerated decelerated always accelerated decelerated accelerated decelerated heavy valve all the more larger forces more less limitation why valve open faster titanium valves installed comparison normal aventador this allowed camshaft contour expect limited means have had it explained goes mild contour exactly made valve opened faster travel faster means more air pure more air pure means pouring in more fuel more fuel means more steam torque curve ankum restaurants equal compression equal lie entire speed range clearly previous hsv top trainer 720 newton meters believe 6200 revolutions 127 meters sc hon notices forehead watch go ok little nonsense yes eco electricity should try drifting thing honestly say youtube internet hardly hits recordings found car propose both problems driving car across believe think easier cars are driving such 355 wrong tires 50 times corsair tires kripp optimized weight balance car 50 50 means turn fast entry step massively say all-wheel drive means go away there are easy meets cars just more easy music music music music music horst krause music evil background stand yes ok go movie think more goes more car transverse four-wheel drive yes actually prevent decoupled already lets rear axle already live notice joy a little yes smoke in front came yes smoke a little impressive conversations couscous meet impress car location work perfectly all-wheel drive meets four-wheel drive car 770 be something saarland action safe car still drive well no totally impressed driving dynamics calm could test high value clean au to announce pouring third goes fast makes explains a little drivability comes with the 4star you always say comes actually already history happened even car proudly stops gas can pull nice clean very briefly gas air in go made lock yes immediately pictures makes power connection yes immediately out exactly means front axle helps principle driver intuitively critical situation power exactly car principle support car insidious worst trust exactly relatively proud say say car of course lamborghini great meaning yes undoubtedly icons cars history massively proudly look at it miura countach diablo murciélago aventador cars instead of young people at some point had a car talks lamborghini see behind it already history cars people ever case bigger murciélago sv big except diablo really close really loves ne soon couple applause music music
