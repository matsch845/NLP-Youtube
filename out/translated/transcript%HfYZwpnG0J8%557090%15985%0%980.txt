why the following video contains technically highly demanding content as well as complex explanations Music today technically things look at urea spoken there is little ruler part produce were invited before going there have to pick someone up Ms. degenhart dr just as mentally ill hole wm driving wrote novellas topic car actually takes place really makes films really scary nowadays today hope even announced questions may find out gives today opponents together state just off drive off diagonally really excited many questions head a little bit of glory merkel erdogan pain gold order get right please follow directional arrow parking lot visitor manager put down can case think it's okay yeah drive new car it's okay nice shuddering several buildings three belief belongs to three buildings exactly motto dangers 16 bugatti greetings emergence therefore there remains problem always talk about belief who is hiding schröder hello sir schröder quiet Rhinelanders yes already diligent conversation believe yes sure yes look nice m40 bypass exciting come on planning mother spots yes exactly mother keep latest project area 54 engine 55 stop topic new world understands look engine yes basic concept yes already strong engine yes camshafts probably noticed a 45 raging engines many reserves clear degree of fulfillment accordingly today who valve in feel really easy combustion chamber keep up full yes yes youtube goes higher therefore closes times important recognize marco recognize maybe recognize say yes recognize know porsche exactly right air-cooled exactly safe bmw yes 54 fashion white believe even yes maybe you have even lecture say recognize yes second 2 liter 16v will 3.5 liter tfsi engine tune hall give history know motorsport no recognize same trick alpine 2 tfsi good demanded white sensor sits case intake camshaft exactly sensor yes relatively wide exceptions chain case same ne wii 2 deep because of that area leave recognizes yes, principle notices, nevertheless, 115 countries four-cylinder novella sees chain gears actually 216 v generally for that head 23 16 company whole plug play profile already exciting never said no sake variant 14 mm hub 54 wall of sound removed or put into operation looks even better high flank curl profile results in stop valve drive geometry successor just straight rather maybe explain very well with the help of valves valve short little roll finally lever gives moment ball far away on top good hydro element already explained oil filled position distance button bumping accidents always keep evenly filled enough stop normal cups measure waters minimum distance cold condition true condition stop minimal possible yes almost perfect difference witness adjustable buttons bumps exactly looks actually around valve know hydro bumps makes smell almost have to measure exactly of course easier thereby probably speed moderately of course that's why n speed solid engines would like to build same mechanical example grab short rolling rocker arm history yes in principle turn hydro higher yes full yes quasi hydro valve stand right busy engine take hydro shocks trainer cindy turn 10,000 government small shocks have you ever heard run believe namely follows create nine seconds 8 seconds teacher oil pressure structure believe more good namely run hear hear really good around 20 people yes hydro finally knows earlier it was said 87 stop already at the end go for a short time know yourself eight then highway difficult then matt tick tick tick tick yes yes there is effect hydro impacts hydraulic team player compensation simply cranks up camshaft revolutions actuation handlebar builds effect valve even more closes prince compression cycle valve should be completely closed is already tenth open skin combustion chamber pressure exhaust valves burns if in doubt even worse of course above structure dementi valve greatly differ i valve cuts wide open yes snowing effect arises cutting torch effect exactly like exhaust exhaust valves always stops always surpass whole longer longer whole system even valve spring block goes collision get spring plate valve head head valve spring collapses would have whole head had whole energy presses fixed places infinitely large force spring plates tear off valves tear off the entire engine so it's fantastic that's why professors really turn up high speed concepts maybe even circuit speed down seem effects arise hydro first choice times curve gear down engine a bit over-revving exactly effect smothered load novella doesn't really matter rotates really means lets connected Teachers throttle valve throttle valve minimally open deer actually doesn't matter comparison load works camshaft first would have camshaft basic middle speed range most pleasant idle camshaft stressful spring forces masses forces part canceled middle speed range fifties balance mass forces spring forces part equalize smallest loads north form neck construction living lever first says lever transmission ratio changes classic cup impacts concept accumulates circumferential point always exactly the same transmission ratio same situation changes at the beginning nothing always straight exactly wing lever rocker arm straight example would be changes transmission ratio touch point lever basic piece far explained explained nissan video e.g. system nissan takes dangers vku 35 38 head goes yes possibility splitting chain control therefore moves briefly first system drives short translation exo vanek center outside pushes yes movement longer drives all well hears variables world stopped exactly stop valves opening angle change event thematic excel table translation change etc are concepts best known maybe bmw f tronic concept yes classic roll lever meanwhile lever excel table below camshaft quite complicated for that table lie lever times clarify a bit lever yes fulcrum fix finger just put in swings lever makes underside valve times quite strengthened camshaft running area lever running area rotation cam catches side starts middle runs side back comes back middle says short length fulcrum contact point running surface means transmission ratio side long lever arm contact line valve underneath remains relatively similar place thereby changing transmission ratio suffers new profile running surface this creates different locations contour side i.e. side clearly hole correct negative radius side clearly beefy soon means valves elevation curve asymmetrical means two shoulders east understand yes contour start-up phase case planning actually chorus wait resulting in living short long lever thereby remembering exactly short long lever why cam novella asymmetrical cash register key stop case transmission ratio comparison corpse changes back emigration shocks yes middle ground circle touch point runs nub contour outside over thereby changes transmission ratio directly simply pushes down class because of nubs controller classes ram motor symmetrical lever motor old nazi motors opel yes quasi bell crank say run symmetrically yes always the same route cuts yes yes bumper tappet down camshaft sits quite normal straight guided button support diameter smaller 20 22 centimeters diameter comes comes key point live deliver better stand push runs bumper up piece up yes lever piece far axis rear comes bumper up gets key rod high movement symmetrical catch any point base pans whole high pans back changes gear ratio pan practically negligible mathematically small opening hours switzerland keep identical insofar results in symmetrical same ko nzert symmetrical valves would like to have to ok could believe continue for a long time honestly admit tuning scene fool titans deep error somehow better says lighter mass inertia small error like topic explained why really works valve drive just already air-conditioned masses forces masses forces combine of course many different topics valve train components move weight acceleration camshaft This generates masses of force goes components transmission ratio one one operated goes masses of force 1 1 1 tappet tight 100 grams already 100 grams must be accelerated must be accelerated the same applies valve immeasurable force environment is suppressed 100 grams more relevant environment no camshaft naturally mechanically theoretically simply infinitely large georgen probably already whole components are falling apart happened infinitely high force great force natural load camshaft clearly increases camshaft calculates let's say surface pressure ruler pressure cam work fabrics insert different endure giving beijing classic wear image pinholes viewed overload surface seen touched ground mass forces error forces ok comes next place wear occurs side occurs high rotating case new tip occurs spring force responsible insofar piece far dependent area cam contour cam lobe valve lobe yes different accelerations acceleration masses force result load oppenweiler endure calculated backwards hardness pressure hold hold case fairly complex systems bit quite simply clarify quite the opposite yes masses force masses force goes straight guided plunger cash register key goes valve weighs 100 grams key 100 grams already have to hit 200 grams comes spring spring plate error plate is on top well correct first beats on top it goes 100 percent valve brought so on top it pushes 100% 1 g/t valve goes 100 percent plate for 100 gram 200 gram 300 gram simple error 100 gram would be all in all 100 gram 200 gram 34 spring yes own error force generates yes resistance yes comes fall spring presses moves error everywhere same below areas stay still bachelor movement at all insofar as 200 gram featherweight times arithmetic move hardly 100 gram of springs means mistake part of weight deduct reduce form reduced mass rough calculations say depending on springs wrapped half spring weight reduced mass takes over means who would be very short actually smart man makes button bumps easier yes okay cash register key case makes titanium valve springs helps yes yes well awesome valve button bumps lighter would formulate heaviest component concept from lighter seldom error doesn't matter place weight saver error plate 23 grams spare valve 5 grams tappet 10 grams lighten somewhere helps load reach speed ie surface pressure goes down higher turn loads reduce more
