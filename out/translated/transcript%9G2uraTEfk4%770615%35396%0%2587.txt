Music welcome to another video performance gmbh beautiful view there is hardly any beautiful track to see says yes about yes today great test to see today hood golf gti beautiful golf gti standing 1400 90 hp yes 1094 hp right point golf gti criticism quite criticism said come need series car vegrad development from here just have a look standard golf gti celebrates design around a bit look golf gti clearly fancy golf eight front does quite well discussion simply escalate simply thought makes more sense makes more sense just drop by anyway simply eight gts nose exactly video series would go exactly over it lot of videos who fumble apart most emotional best brakes brakes best braking golf gti emotions driving behavior design video series gti fan olympus music kers buy challenge league see free comes cops first disc is called branch bills models bmw fell plan excel base see live come music puck league times luxembourg puree ik imre szabics music is due music catch big 1 go first say in advance crass monogram flew first turn yes already extremely think stop golf gti anyway video series made think really makes order goes marx unbelievably nice increase car car development really nice follow single giugiaro basic design 112 ps golf 1 gti increase try get together think nine years later it was 88 six times six exactly five years shortly after think six choice relatively long choice nine take a long time golf 7 g/t yes already perfect car cycles catch love yes correct golf 1 gti steer design today completely timeless simply chic beautiful always for the eye really great this morning 280 sea dangers always happens quite huge told do very rarely own climb honor do cool camera somehow something aigen increased course place look speedometer motor starts make choose good really always super good car 74 great auto 105 double headlight light front lip full always with the g olf 1 gti front nose always nicest saying normal 1 car tolerates belief gave tree could order red framed great volkswagen makes really praise car came out extra eighth next to it basic ideas yes eyes keep many years in between okay time both time anyway ideas always go around development 1 2 There were always different engines in the golf gti there was always car white true 216 needs the front engine wonders wonders beautiful engine goes well tuning potential victory stability engine fantastic means example engine golf 1 mother already cool card tonic really really great 6 effects equations big difference in performance let seafarers believe certain areas successor worse ratio performance came comfort walking people wanted became tall means believe thinner car became difficult ratio more performance more torque have to have to look believe quite good shape looks nice growth philosophy find growth similar porsche bumper put on metal dress with two weber 49 plastic bumper easy removal with 3 with four griether 38 more cantata bumper body dress plastic grow cars more and more ideal face yes always goes red grill little gone well weigh bread nice car handle 3 g/d youth big dream bbs wheels two-part wheels bbs wheels on the golf 1 gti periodic pirelli re on it chic classic car young people wanted today there was always a two-liter engine smaller engine case 18 despite topicality almost 6 p.m. current gti speaks volumes current gti 18 yes total back then people saw something like that stood train stations driving off feeling tram sit done b1 long u7 40 dortmunder looks rushing sat man woman golf 3 gt e head cinema see dream fantastic golf 3 due nowadays at least sees hears right gti talked about tim golf 3g somewhere numbers on the other hand sometimes the same bit statistics rhein start objection cars bit bit chatting felt gti golf gti present first stage physics vr6 market came in 26 gave yes golf 2 spryng lich many retrofitted think most swap stories gives germany golf 2 46 rebuilds even young people know think mass informative two v6 bought thought captain golf 26 gave originally inside gave 28 29 synchro all-wheel drive gave rats golf country ever car technology come airbags come everyone comes in airbag car everyone comes golf 4 gti jean-pierre already full start love comparison equal minimal bondage somehow anniversary model jubi 180 hp had beautiful bbs wheels small front lip headlights dark side skirts rear diffuser cool tailpipe can find look tailpipe see smile then entertain big big original comments gti therefore culture tailpipes yes grown tailpipes did not exist manufacturer came stop jubi ballermann tailpipe came first 32 golf 4 vr6 engine 3.2 liters personally find golf 4 car golf together at least aged eye always attractive say two en would have to use Golf 2 simply ahead simply significantly older says zwahlen development pages 1 2 happy for that year older always attractive four find attractive coming fifth five weight retracted performance rhein cars arrived at that time originally two-liter tfsi engine toothed belt engine 200 hp first gti then bought new book example wind technology loaded car really say gave first xenon headlights error 5 direct injection start image ots came models always came more extreme driving behavior probably better ax geometry front axle wheel carrier differentials stiffer cars quiet times technically henning become significantly better yes esp system just not straps can still hold on car saves helps catch cars really think new generation actions came new generation big wheels were grew golf 4 then eight and a half x 18 x 18 era technology driven space travel needed biggest step found four five 34 biggest 343 three four got more attached black parts angel clips things transition bird bar comes carriage body designer start body modeling day even if closed form plastic manufacturing process fabric carriage fine point arrive at golf eight e.g. front stand always reason says actually grill look closely look little paint surface front look opening small intercooler side small machine please caricature face laughed golf 1 even mouth golf 2 makes straight bar looks just as it were 13 that's how long it started tsi engines turbo engines moved in 18 inside famous engine europe turbo really already potential girl bang bigger and bigger yes shape five six yes identical wide drawn seven wider shape tipped yes originally six in the seven tipped fed bigger when makes stop complete yes more really jumps 5 already separation old new someone says gold in between always bought gold ask older newer would be clear why separation say older golfs new autumn world navigation navigation green light green green blue work change techno Logic drive train naturally aspirated turbo means jump times direct injection xenon is more and more 66 opinion six example super great front great car a little bit lost car think both generally little thoughts quite even however seven gti always in it perfection everyday car fully hammered car complete comes 2000 somehow yes right knowledge preserved hate put down appoint opinion name holztage trend true rum houses openly bypass writes yes have to deal with times discussed car was sold well both scenes strong easy help say yes four white santander bank leased josef ackermann say super g 30 remove super cars always tick ahead emotional yes expensive package find out golf 7 fantastic car eighth de works in various ways 8 ever video sideline really striking 7 ok get out sideline makes dead topic say gti story out gets the eighth much more attractive normal golf 8 people already talked a few times n car closer says driving dynamics real increase potential from engines technical 888 believe knows identifier engine fourth generation believe in it yes four good 84 most exhaust gas values ​​really hurt difference exactly relatively many identical components in both vehicles why save money no engine burns pretty well just two liters tfsi range already benchmark thus intercooler very many identical components of both cars look closely even say research a-pillar even identical is front car bodywork is stuck same car platform same ball coupé developed yes case modular transverse modular system can make money product range volkswagen let me know think a minor identical predecessor vehicle reproachful times looks at a-pillars find detail lost straight notices a pillar golf 1 gti black distribution black line goes whole autobahn a23 just as two at 475 must be mentioned there exactly at golf 4 gti gave little find cult lost golf i gti real problem namely alone only 150 hp somehow sits gti attributes real gti found at the 5er gave own bumper at the foursome real front bumper golf 4 always the same always the same lip at the jubi normal gti quite normal red line somehow exactly three black thing in the front somehow yes comes the end animals actually exactly 5 white grill grill first step say engine always look at engine hoods just look at engine rooms developed newspaper so far could see engines everywhere engines opened catch the golf 1 gti 112 hp 18 engine car jetronic see videos times car peter thanks do by the way fixed stands looks mechanical cable gas repair friendly due to map trolley thinks start right time system guarantor for higher performance driving good response yes forgot engines were currently true may only past great honor aggressive extremely vehicle weight 4 700 800 kilo 112 hp always jump 18 engine 129 hp already beautiful valve cover Yes, says brück l drawbridge already makes car response above clearly clearly more chic goes use vehicle weight a bit high dhc double mastiffs above environment in the golf 1 gti double camshaft above four-valve head 2 wenzel head go second engine 115 hp camshaft above 16 v gave 16 v yes unfortunately today makes breinig means air mass meter slowly comes technology cars purely smart better better problematic car power-to-weight ratio more ideal at 2 1 at 3 think two smaller lagging things see chassis technology better weight-to-weight ratio worse come here at engine 1781 cubic centimeters 180 hp normal version 150 hp 1 5 valve head especially particularly particularly vulnerable timing belt engine double camshaft above of course e gas engine believe there were 18 e engines quite simply even cable technology difference really cool yes even measurement believe 900 two already blatant difference run off rest run off beautiful car important were engines slowly Heavier, heavier, heavier intercooler, larger water cooler, possible add-on parts, come in, cars, things, larger, larger, larger, step car, more extreme, lives Golf 5 g/t au 1 cars, first time dual-clutch transmission, no, wrong, very briefly, gave believe, March 32, dsg, yes, gave Golf 4 32, even dsg, many people at that time fast turning car had to drive golf double coupler switched car shape yes but 5 understand at that time gave gti normal jammers gave manual switch double clutch gave 2 hp 230 hp e30 engine toothed belt engine chain yes chains engines are located at the rear tuning potential really cool thing would have been very fresh golf back then 5 delivered only new car fiddled mtm then software got tried performance team really went office air mass meter exciting car neither golfer delivered tv cell phone sit magnifying glass box part lid ok lid removed lid really sensibly get on really shit gets lid never sensibly on engine see really big differences de hip air filter box inside okay exciting golf 6 gti exactly 35 little difference between the two engines namely 30 km 04 alaba carnell fell unfortunately big differences coming gold 7 gti beautiful engine say career tuning most fun extreme results gives extremely good transmission extremely good engine extremely good location technology leap Manifold part of the head at that time something dismantled it has become understood loosely when dismantling somehow always drop loading do screwed flood motor on it smart thing win head out flows fun weight fun installation space yes music a little narrower this allowed the motor to move a little behind all the little things could stop thing concept 888 motor always means to develop engine coming means potential engine simply gigantic of course 16 v lky valve head personal explain a bit I like to drive engine potential feeling sound performance really quite good Mr. Geiger golf 1 gti completely held know car say slowly for a long time have looked at many things time folksw agen golf gti already two three years known car technology taken over seven improved strong engine area ugly driving dynamics chassis area really massively increased characteristic car response los confirmed really nice came op records sound character upstairs exhaust gas temperature thus full expansion highway upstairs a little less entertaining eg 7 say say bring over our first discipline driving cars 100 driving cars 100 0 100 0 braking braking unimportant it matters let get up far width straight means coming down behind 100 look for line brakes brake exact point car stops see exactly when car comes to a standstill abs requirement car stops get consequences get flat tires brings peter namely means nice sensible clean brakes yes abs rises of course full arms ok say catch 900 yes degrees post message received just finished take video again beginning straight comes tomorrow would like bayern only tomorrow cut takes a long time watching video country tomorrow 100 braking 0 general driving behavior evaluation tomorrow yes evaluate done yes white yes fast can only end maybe really sorry believe fun tomorrow music applause music
